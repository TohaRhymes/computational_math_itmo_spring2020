### Topics:
* **Approxinate integration** using Simpsons Rule - `lab2_integration.ipynb`
* **Root-finding_algorithms**. Newton's method, Secant method and Fixed-point_iteration method was realised - `lab3_root_finding.ipynb` + some data for this program at `lab3_input/` folder.
* **Function approximation** using the method of Least squares (for several types of function) - `lab4_approximation.ipynb` + some data for this program at `lab45_input/` folder.
* **Interpolation** using Lagrange polynomial and Newton polynomial. - `lab5_interpolation.ipynb`. + some data for this program at `lab45_input/` folder.
